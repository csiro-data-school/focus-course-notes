Push is a feature in Rstudio which allows you to push your 'data' up to github 
The push feature is only available once your project has been linked to github
If your project has been cloned from github this is already a feature 
If yours is a new project you will need to ensure 'create a file repository'is selcted 
If you are working with multiple people you may find it hard to push your project as you may not have the most recent version in Rstudio 
If this happens simply pull down a new version and then push immediatley
